        <h3> Understanding Autism </h3>
        <hr>
        <p> Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological disorder comprised of numerous characteristics.
          These include inattention, sensory sensitivities, obsessive-compulsive tendencies, narrow ranges of interests, distinct repetitive behaviours, poor executive function, and difficulties in socialising, connecting and empathising with others.
          The severity of each characteristic varies in each individual as autism is a spectrum.</p>

        <h3> About Us </h3>
        <hr>
        <p> Understanding Le Chéile is a social enterprise led by a dedicated team of students of National University of Ireland, Galway.
          Our aim is to teach a fundamental awareness to Businesses and Second Level Education Institutes around Ireland. With our interactive and thought-provoking workshops, students and employees alike will leave with a better understanding of autism
          and comfortably know how to interact and support autistic people in the workplace and society.</p>
